            Jay Walker (born Jay Gordon[1]) is the current Elemental Master and Ninja of Lightning, Nya's boyfriend
            and Yin, and the adoptive son of Ed and Edna Walker, surrendered by his biological parents, Cliff Gordon
            and his wife. He learned skills including Spinjitzu and discovered his other teammates, with whom he
            embarked on many adventures; battling the likes of the Serpentine and the Stone Army. During this time
            Jay formed a romantic relationship with Kai's sister, Nya.
            After Lloyd defeated the Overlord, peace resumed until The Overlord returned and created an army of
            Nindroids that were made from Zane's blueprints. A love triangle formed between Jay, Nya, and Cole,
            which remained after Zane seemingly died. The ninja parted ways after Zane's death, but upon learning of
            his survival, they journeyed to Chen's Island and entered the Tournament of Elements. Cole made amends
            with Jay over his relationship with Nya, and the ninja and Elemental Masters fought the Anacondrai
            Cultists. Soon after, Jay would help the ninja battle Morro and a legion of cursed spirits while
            learning another martial art called Airjitzu, and they were then faced with Nadakhan, who trapped many
            of the ninja in his sword. Jay and Nya battled the Sky Pirates, but when Nya was poisoned by the Tiger
            Widow venom and killed, Jay used his last wish to undo the recent events.
            <br>
            <br>
            On the Day of the Departed, Jay and his parents were attacked by a revived Samukai, who Jay defeated
            with help from Ronin. Jay joined his allies in battling the Time Twins and the Vermillion, as well as
            seeking the powerful Time Blades. Though their enemies were defeated, Wu was lost in the Temporal
            vortex.
            <br>
            <br>
            A year later, Jay helped battle a notorious gang that resurrected Lord Garmadon and was ultimately
            stranded in the Realm of Oni and Dragons with the other original ninja and Wu.
            <br>
            <br>
            During their first week being stranded in the realm, Jay temporarily loses his sanity and ends up being
            captured by the Dragon Hunters along with Kai and Zane. After hearing Lloyd's voice on a radio, Jay
            regains his state of mind and devises a plan to free Zane, Kai, and himself from the Dragon Hunters, and
            designs a Firstbourne Mech to provide a distraction. They manage to escape with Cole and a growing Wu's
            assistance before meeting a Hunter named Faith who tells them about the Dragon Armor and they
            immediately head for it. Wu manages to find the armor and becomes the Golden Dragon Master, and with the
            Firstbourne and some dragons, they return home to Ninjago to help the Resistance defeat Colossus, while
            at the same time, Jay reunites with Nya.
            <br>
            <br>
            Shortly afterward, Jay decides it's time to ask Nya to be his Yang. He sought out advice from Kai but
            his plans get put on hold when the Oni invade Ninjago. During the final battle at the Monastery, he
            finally mustered up the courage to ask Nya, which she happily agrees to. After using the Tornado of
            Creation on the Oni, Jay joins his fellow ninja in the creation of the new mural.
            <br>
            <br>
            Months later, Jay and his friends fight against Aspheera and her Pyro Vipers after accidentally
            releasing them from their tomb. After Zane is banished by Aspheera's sorcery, he and the remaining ninja
            send themselves to the Never-Realm in order to rescue him. While Lloyd went to find Zane, Jay and the
            others protected the Ice Fishers of Great Lake. The ninja fight Boreal the Ice Dragon, and discover that
            Zane is the Ice Emperor. With Zane having managed to return to his senses in a fight with Lloyd and
            freeing the Never-Realm from its eternal winter, the team reunites and use the berry Krag gave Cole to
            head back to their home realm.
            <br>
            <br>
            Sometime later, Jay is the first of the ninja to enter the virtual world of Prime Empire, resulting in
            the legendary arcade game resurfacing and hundreds of gamers getting trapped in it. Jay becomes known as
            Superstar Rockin' Jay to the League of Jay. The ninja enter in search of the Key-Tanas and Unagami,
            thinking that finding him would solve the situation. But by the time the ninja get the last Key-Tana,
            Jay and Nya are the only surviving ninja left in the game. The duo progresses but Nya gets cubed in the
            process, which makes Jay distraught and the only ninja left, so he moves on to follow Unagami through
            the completed Manifestation Gate into Ninjago. He and Milton Dyer successfully console Unagami into
            releasing the formerly trapped gamers, as well as everyone who was formerly cubed, including the ninja
            (Kai, Cole, Lloyd, and Nya).
            <br>
            <br>
            Later, Jay and the rest of his friends were invited to Shintaro in honor of Princess Vania's birthday.
            Shortly after arriving, the ninja were forced to split up inside the mountain the kingdom lied on when
            they were under the attack of the Skull Sorcerer. During his time with the Munce who lived in the
            Dungeons of Shintaro, Jay was caught in a love triangle between Nya and Murtessa, the Queen of the
            Munce. He and his friends convinced the Munce to work with the Geckles and vice versa to defeat the
            Skull Sorcerer. They were successful and they departed on search for another adventure.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Ninja then traveled to an island in search of Wu and Misako. It was there that they were captured by
            the Keepers and Jay was hailed as the "Gift of Jay." Initially thinking they wanted him to be their
            king, Jay was delighted until realizing they wanted to sacrifice him to the ancient sea serpent, Wojira.
            Fortunately, it was just a fake built by Ronin to steal the islanders' fortune and Jay and the other
            ninja found Wu and Misako and made amends with the Keepers.
            <br>
            <br>
            After Nya's powers go haywire during an attempt to stop a bunch of criminals, Jay and a few of the
            others traveled under the Endless Sea to investigate what could be the source of the problem. During the
            adventure, Jay would continuously comfort Nya over her problems. When they realized that the problem
            behind Nya's powers was Kalmaar trying to awaken Wojira with fake Storm Amulets, the ninja did
            everything in their power to stop him from getting the real one. Despite their efforts, Kalmaar managed
            to awaken Wojira and Jay was left in critical condition due to inhaling a large amount of water, causing
            him to suffer from air drowning. Nya then decides to merge with the sea to draw the water out of Jay and
            defeats Kalmaar and Wojira. She then says goodbye to her friends as she dives into the ocean. Jay was
            the most saddened by her fate and fell into depression.
            <br>
            <br>
            A year after Nya's departure, Jay moved to Lighthouse Island and essentially became a hermit before
            learning from Nya that the only way to return her to normal is to remove her Elemental Power. While Kai,
            Zane and Lloyd break Aspheera out of Kryptarium, Jay and Cole fail to recover her staff, which is later
            revealed to be in the hands of the New Ninja, but manage to steal it, and return Nya back to normal
            before being arrested by them and sent to Kyptarium, where they learn of the Crystal King. After Nya and
            Dareth break them out, Jay, along with Cole and Lloyd, as well as fellow convict Fugi-Dove, seperate
            from the others to evade the police and reunite at Twitchy Tim's gas station, where they form a plan to
            infiltrate the Council of the Crystal King.
